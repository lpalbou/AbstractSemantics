# Acknowledgments

This project builds on excellent open-source work and open standards:

- **PyYAML**: YAML parsing used to load the semantics registry (`src/abstractsemantics/registry.py`).
- **pytest**: test runner for the package (`tests/`).
- **llms.txt proposal**: guidance for LLM-friendly documentation manifests (see `llms.txt`).
- **Shared vocabularies** referenced by the default registry (`src/abstractsemantics/semantics.yaml`): RDF, Dublin Core Terms (dcterms), Schema.org, SKOS, and CiTO.

Thank you to all maintainers and contributors of these projects and standards.
