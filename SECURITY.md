## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues **privately** and responsibly:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue with exploit details.
2. If this repository is hosted on GitHub and supports it, use **Security → Report a vulnerability** (preferred).
3. If private reporting is not available, open a minimal public issue that requests a private contact channel (do not include sensitive details).

## What to include

- A clear description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (prefer a minimal proof-of-concept)
- Affected versions/commits if known
- Any suggested fix or mitigation (optional)

## Supported versions

Security fixes are provided for the latest released version in the `0.x` series.
